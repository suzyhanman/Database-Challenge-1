Steps to Improve Query Performance for Books Table

1. Indexing

By default all Foreign keys are being indexed as they will frequently referenced in queries. AS the application is in use we monitor performance and identify columns frquently used in 
WHERE clauses, JOINs, and ORDER BY clauses. 

2. Database Maintenance

	2.1	Regularly Update Statistics:
			Ensure that database statistics are updated regularly to help the query optimizer make informed decisions. I usually execute sp-updatestats at the end of each script I run against the database
	2.2	Fragment Tables:
			Periodically defragment tables and rebuild indexes to improve access speed.
		
3. Database Optimization

	3.1 Analyze and Optimize Queries:
		Review the execution plans of slow queries to identify bottlenecks. Use tools such as EXPLAIN in SQL to get insights into how queries are executed.
	3.2 Optimize SQL Queries:
		Rewrite inefficient queries, reduce subqueries, and ensure the use of JOINs instead of nested queries where appropriate.

4. Database Partitioning

	4.1 Horizontal Partitioning:
		Partitioning the Books table based on a scertain attribute as Genre or Language for example so the amout of data being retrieved is way less than before.
	4.2 Vertical Partitioning:
		Split the table where the columns that are not frequently accessing are in a seperate table.

5. Caching

	5.1 Implement Query Caching:
		In-memory caching solution to cache results of frequently accessed queries.
	5.2 Application-Level Caching:
		Cache the results on the application side to reduce load on the database for repeated requests.



6. Upgrade Hardware
	Upgrading server resources (CPU, RAM, SSD storage) or moving to a more powerful database server (if all of the above did not help).

7. Database Sharding

8. Distribute the Load:
 	If data is continuously growing at a fast pace, consider implementing sharding to distribute the database across multiple servers. This approach requires significant architectural changes but can vastly improve performance.

8. Use of Full-Text Search (if applicable)
	If text searches are a common requirement as searching titles, consider using full-text indexing to speed up these queries.
